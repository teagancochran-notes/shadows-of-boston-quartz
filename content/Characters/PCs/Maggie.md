**Original Name:** [[Maggie|Samantha Sutherland]]
**Age**: P31Y8M2W4D

> [!previously]- Backstory
> [[Maggie|Samantha Sutherland]] grew up in an very religious household with her mother, father and elder brother. She never felt that she fit in with her family and would often rebel; sneaking out to go party with her friends.
>
> When she was 16 she fell pregnant and rather then face her family's judgement, she ran away from home to live with the baby's father. She never saw her family again, although years later she would learn that her mother and father had died in a car crash and brother had been murdered.
>
> To make money, Maggie turned to crime, often breaking into houses or businesses, and was arrested a number of times. When her daughter was three, her partner fled outstanding arrest warrants, leaving the city and her behind.
>
> To provide for her daughter, Maggie began escalating her crimes and in 2010 marked a residence of [[../NPCs/Emmitt Delmar|Emmitt Delmar]]. She managed to pull off the job, getting away with a large amount of jewellery but was later tracked down by [[../NPCs/Emmitt Delmar|Emmitt]]. She was given two options: die here and now or work for him and both her and her daughter would be provided for. At the time, she didn't realise that both options were a death sentence.
>
> True to his word, [[../NPCs/Emmitt Delmar|Emmitt]] took care of her daughter and turned Maggie. In kind, she is extremely loyal to him and has been working in the [[../../Organisations/Regatta|Regatta]] for 11 years.
