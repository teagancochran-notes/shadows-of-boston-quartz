# Notes
## Gameplay
- If you say it's been x amount of days does that just mean we automatically just refill whatever we had?
	- For the most part. Some will not refill, for example, if you take aggravated willpower damage that takes a while to refill or you need to spend time with a touchstone to refill.
- If it's just all superficial?
	- For the most part. If your entire track has been superficial you can only heal so much at a time yeah but yeah if you guys do take damage I let you know if you've had the time to heal up

[[../Characters/PCs/Zeffér|Zeffér]] and [[../Characters/PCs/Maggie|Maggie]] found out 50% of the information 

- The company [[../Organisations/Regatta|Regatta]] came to power in the late 80s and since then has works as a parent company to many large production firms until the mid 2000s where a transition to sustainable and humanitarian projects began
	- In the 80s the focus of the company was industrialisation and mass production for profit before a overnight switch in the mid 2000s
	- [[../Characters/PCs/Maggie|Maggie]] has only known them for the humanitarian focus and never knew they were 

- [[../Characters/NPCs/Swan|Osana]] has been the only head of [[../Organisations/Regatta|Regatta]] since its creation though the council itself has gone through a couple members in its life
	- Already known by [[../Characters/PCs/Maggie|Maggie]]
## Story
> The nights get colder as the year begins to progress. Slowly but surely Autumn's passing through. Before long Winter, will arrive. Though the cold does bring much sadness and struggle with it, it opens up the night for all Kindred.  It's the time to truly cut loose but that hasn't quite arrived yet. As the day people walk around focusing on business and work, a couple of the outer skirt suburbs are getting ready for Halloween. Beginning to put up decorations pumpkins.  Beginning to hit the supermarkets good for carving. There's still a large majority of fun-sized candy on a lot of the shelves slowly disappearing but our story doesn't start in the day it start at night and this night comes with a story of its own.
> 
> Boston carries many stories on many figures we talked first of the Baba Yaga - a witch in the shadows ready to do deals but will the cost be worth it - but there's another story I want to focus on tonight. A lot more common to most folks; read more in fairy tale than back room sort of dealings or an old forgotten overseas nursery rhyme. The one I talk about is very common heard in many literature. It's very simple. It's a story of a big bad wolf. But the difference with that wolf is that wolf tells its own story doesn't give a about what any of your nightbringers think. The wolf cares for itself; the wolf cares for its pack; that's it. Heard some fun stories about three little pigs? Blew some houses down? No I caved them in, ate them dirty ass pigs for breakfast! Story of Little Red? No, she didn't survive. The grandmother was dead before she hit the floor. Huntsman paid off because he's a little bitch! My bitch!
> 
> And all Boston's going to be my bitch soon. You don't fuck with a wolf and expect to get out alive. You don't mess with a wolf's pack and expecting to get anything. So watch out you bleeders, blood suckers; the night may be yours but I'm going to take it fang by claw and I hope you're ready and who knows I might let you out alive can't wait to see your punk ass bitches soon

- [[../Characters/NPCs/Swan|Osana]] says his way of arriving in [[../Organisations/Regatta|Regatta]] custody was unfortunate

		- [[../Characters/PCs/Saul|Saul]] starts to ask what type of other Kindred but stops and says it doesn't matter because the answer is obviously the other Kindred
		- [[../Characters/NPCs/Hawk|Hawk]] proposes his question a different way using the trolley problem "To kill one of our members, you would save two human lives. To kill some other kindred you would only save one"
		- [[../Characters/PCs/Saul|Saul]] says that [[../Characters/NPCs/Emmitt Delmar|Crow]]'s question and [[../Characters/NPCs/Hawk|Hawk]]'s questions are contradictory (one asked about killing Kindred who intend to harm human lives and the other if he would harm a council member if they intended on harming human lives)
		- [[../Characters/NPCs/Hawk|Hawk]] responds that he never said either would be harming humans but about saving them by killing
		- [[../Characters/PCs/Saul|Saul]] asks if he has to choose which [[../Characters/NPCs/Hawk|Hawk]] tells him choice is all he has and aggressively tells him to make it

			- [[../Characters/PCs/Saul|Saul]] asks if that is the question but she just stares and then her neck crooks down a bit too far than it should be able
			- [[../Characters/PCs/Saul|Saul]] responds that it is probably because he won't get to see the end myself the way he is going 
			- [[../Characters/NPCs/Owl|Owl]]'s neck crooks back little the opposite way and says that the answer was cryptic but acceptable
- [[../Characters/NPCs/Swan|Osana]] asks if he is ready for their question which [[../Characters/PCs/Saul|Saul]] answers disrespectfully which annoys [[../Characters/NPCs/Swan|Osana]] @34:29

			- [[../Characters/NPCs/Swan|Osana]] states that there's a reason kindred are called [[Canite|Canite]]s and suggests that kindred already live a hell on Earth

	- [[../Characters/NPCs/Trisha|Trish]] clarifies that she means that something made him do something for the hotel
	- [[../Characters/PCs/Saul|Saul]] responds that if he sees a group of Kindred trying to use people for sport that he is going to start trying to rip them apart
	- [[../Characters/NPCs/Trisha|Trish]] questions that he only intervened because he saw it
	- [[../Characters/PCs/Saul|Saul]] responds that if she has the ability to show him Kindred wrongdoings he can't see, hear or find on his own then to give him names
	- [[../Characters/NPCs/Trisha|Trish]] questions if that before he saw it he was just in blissful ignorance and says it seems odd that only tales of this magnitude are appearing now and, that for someone who truly hates Kindred so much, that they haven't done anything before now

- [[../Characters/PCs/Saul|Saul]] responds "If you wanted my loyalty, you wouldn't have brought me here in chains. You make it sound as if it's altruism, as if you could have just left me to be dust but then I wake up and you tell me I can either be your puppet or go back to being dust, that's all."
- [[../Characters/NPCs/Swan|Osana]] sighs and announces the chains will stay, [[../Characters/PCs/Saul|Saul]] lives
- [[../Characters/PCs/Saul|Saul]] breaks his chains as a point rather than an act of violence then folds his arms and stand there

> They say a wolf is a solitary creature. It's not. It runs in packs runs, with those it trusts and you don't fight those it trusts because whether it be some corporate ass motherfucker or some lick who thinks they can get slick past me, I'll fuck any of them up. It's what wolves do. And like I said, don't make enemies of us, you'll come to regret it
