# Summary
[[../Characters/PCs/Zeffér|Zeffér]] and [[../Characters/PCs/Sasha|Sasha]] are given the task by their respective organisations to capture [[../Characters/NPCs/Damien Hausberg|Damien Hausberg]] - an escapee from [[../Events/The Incident|The Incident]]. Meanwhile, [[../Characters/PCs/Saul|Saul]] is tasked to kill the hunter that his after the escapees. [[../Characters/PCs/Sasha|Sasha]] hires Magi, [[../Characters/NPCs/Kiki|Kiki]] to locate [[../Characters/NPCs/Damien Hausberg|Damien]]. They, [[../Characters/PCs/Zeffér|Zeffér]] and [[../Characters/PCs/Saul|Saul]] all find themselves at an office complex where [[../Characters/PCs/Zeffér|Zeffér]] and [[../Characters/PCs/Sasha|Sasha]] team up and fight [[../Characters/PCs/Saul|Saul]] and the Feds. The fight eventually leads them to [[../Places/Boston/Miss Kiki's Healing Center|Kiki's Shop]] were they encounter the hunter [[../Characters/PCs/Saul|Saul]] is after, where [[../Characters/NPCs/Kiki|Kiki]] is shot and [[../Characters/PCs/Zeffér|Zeffér]] is [[Entrancement|entranced]]. The group stall long enough for the [[../Organisations/Anarchs|Anarchs]] to show up and get [[../Characters/NPCs/Damien Hausberg|Damien]]. Unbeknownst to them, [[../Characters/PCs/Zeffér|Zeffér]] also stalls to allow [[../Organisations/Regatta|Regatta]] agents to get in place to intercept. Although ultimately successful in his mission, [[../Characters/PCs/Zeffér|Zeffér]] loses control of the beast which has fatal consequences for his driver. Accidents happen, or so they say.
