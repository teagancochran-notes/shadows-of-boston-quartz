[[../Characters/NPCs/Kirkman|Kirkman]] filled a hotel in [[../Places/Boston/index|Boston]] where his birthday party was being held with humans to be hunted for entertainment during [[../Sessions/Session 1|Session 1]]. No humans were supposed to be left alive by the end of the night however [[../Characters/PCs/Saul|Saul]] managed to rescue a number of them. [[../Characters/PCs/Maggie|Maggie]] assisted [[../Characters/PCs/Saul|Saul]] in rescuing one escapee but did not stay the rest of the night.

[[../Characters/PCs/Sasha|Sasha]], [[../Characters/PCs/Amelia|Amelia]], [[../Characters/PCs/Zeffér|Zeffér]] and [[../Characters/NPCs/Trisha|Trisha]] were aware of what was happening but decided to leave the party to get cake instead.

In [[../Sessions/Session 4|Session 4]], [[../Characters/PCs/Maggie|Maggie]] learnt that more humans escaped than just the one's [[../Characters/PCs/Saul|Saul]] saved. These witnesses begin going missing and many of the factions want to find them for their own purposes. [[../Characters/PCs/Maggie|Maggie]] is tasks with tracking down two of these witnesses.
