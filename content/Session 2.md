# Summary
[[Zeffér]] and [[Sasha]] are given the task by their respective organisations to capture [[Damien Hausberg]] - an escapee from [[The Incident]]. Meanwhile, [[Saul]] is tasked to kill the hunter that his after the escapees. [[Sasha]] hires Magi, [[Kiki]] to locate [[Damien Hausberg|Damien]]. They, [[Zeffér]] and [[Saul]] all find themselves at an office complex where [[Zeffér]] and [[Sasha]] team up and fight [[Saul]] and the Feds. The fight eventually leads them to [[Miss Kiki's Healing Center|Kiki's Shop]] were they encounter the hunter [[Saul]] is after, where [[Kiki]] is shot and [[Zeffér]] is [[Entrancement|entranced]]. The group stall long enough for the [[Anarchs|Anarchs]] to show up and get [[Damien Hausberg|Damien]]. Unbeknownst to them, [[Zeffér]] also stalls to allow [[Regatta]] agents to get in place to intercept. Although ultimately successful in his mission, [[Zeffér]] loses control of the beast which has fatal consequences for his driver. Accidents happen, or so they say. ^summary
