\
[[Maggie]] and [[Zeffér]] investigate a reported sighting of two reappearing witnesses at a [[Homeless Shelter]]. They find one of their marks, a man who under [[Maggie]]'s [[Mesmerise]] reveals he was rescued by a friend known as [[The Rat]] but has little memory of [[The Incident]]. The man is revealed to have been turned into a [[Gangrel]] as a fight breaks out, however is is restrained and taken to [[Detainment]].
